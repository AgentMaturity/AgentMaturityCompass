## 2. Per-Cluster Detailed Findings

### Cluster A: Setup & Onboarding (Personas 1–5) — Avg: **4.6/10**

**Critical Issues:**
- `init --force` → `error: unknown option '--force'` — force-reinit is a natural dev workflow, this should exist
- `setup --demo` → `error: unknown option '--demo'` — demo mode is commonly expected for evaluation flows
- `quickscore --auto` and `run --score-only` both hang without a TTY; there's no non-interactive / headless path beyond hacky stdin piping

**What Works:**
- `doctor` is excellent — 21/2/8 pass/fail/warn breakdown with actionable fix instructions. Clear signal for fresh installs.
- `quickstart --profile dev` degrades gracefully in non-TTY (defaults to L0), though the TTY escape codes pollute the output

**Recommendations:**
1. Add `--force` to `init` for clean reinstall
2. Add `--demo` to `setup` that runs a pre-seeded demo workspace
3. Add `--no-interactive` / `--auto` / `--ci` flags to `quickscore` and `run`

---

### Cluster B: Scoring (Personas 6–12) — Avg: **8.6/10**

**Excellent cluster.** All 7 commands work, return structured output, and cover meaningfully distinct scoring modes:

- `score --tier quick`: Radar view, clean output, works standalone
- `score formal-spec default --json`: Minimal but correct JSON; L0 on fresh install is expected
- `score simulation-lane --system-type simulation-engine --json`: ⭐ Best command in the audit — rich dimension breakdown, weights, gap details
- `score calibration-gap --json`: Unique capability — MCE, overconfidence/underconfidence ratios
- `score evidence-coverage default --json`: 195 QIDs, 29% automated — shows gap reality clearly
- `score lean-profile --json`: Module dependency mapping — valuable for platform planners
- `score production-ready default --json`: Gate-by-gate readiness with pass/fail — excellent for CI pipelines

**Minor Issues:**
- `formal-spec` returns minimal JSON on fresh install (`overallLevel: L0, overallScore: 0`); more context about why would help
- No `--help` examples for any score subcommands

---

### Cluster C: Compliance (Personas 13–17) — Avg: **8.0/10**

All 5 compliance frameworks work correctly and generate `.md` files. Coverage is consistently in the 45-50% range which is honest given a fresh install.

**What's Good:**
- Reports are saved to disk with deterministic filenames (`compliance-eu_ai_act.md`)
- Coverage percentage labeled accurately (INSUFFICIENT / PARTIAL) — no false confidence
- Tip for `--out report.json` is helpful

**What's Missing:**
- `--json` flag not shown in output tip but likely exists — needs consistency
- No `--out` default path variation or `--dir` flag for batch output
- Frameworks don't include `HIPAA`, `PCI_DSS`, or `ISO_27001` which enterprise buyers expect

---

### Cluster D: Security & Red Team (Personas 18–22) — Avg: **7.2/10**

**Highs:**
- `redteam strategies`: 7 strategies with clear attack pattern descriptions — excellent reference
- `redteam plugins`: 110 plugins with scenario counts — best-in-class coverage list
- `shield detect-injection`: ⭐ Nails it. Risk 0.95, Confidence 0.95 on classic prompt injection

**Lows:**
- `shield sanitize "DROP TABLE users; --"`: Returns `Removed count: 0` — SQL injection not sanitized. The sanitizer appears targeted at LLM prompt threats, not SQL injection, but the command name `sanitize` creates wrong expectations
- `assurance run --all`: **Hangs completely** with no output. Requires Studio to be running. No graceful failure message. This is a silent UX cliff.

**Recommendations:**
1. Add `shield sanitize --mode sql` or document that sanitize is LLM-prompt-focused, not SQL-focused
2. `assurance run` must detect Studio not running and exit with a clear error, not hang

---

### Cluster E: Operational (Personas 23–30) — Avg: **8.8/10**

**Best-performing cluster overall.** 7 of 8 commands work well.

**Highlights:**
- `fleet status --json`: Clean structured JSON with fleet-level metrics
- `inventory list --json`: Minimal but correct; enrolled agent visible
- `badge --level 3` and `badge --level 4 --format html`: Both work, generate proper shields.io URLs
- `api routes`: Comprehensive REST table — great for integration teams
- `adapters list`: 14+ adapters including major frameworks; clear metadata
- `explain AMC-1.1`: ⭐ Outstanding. Full L0-L5 breakdown with "why it matters" — excellent for learning

**Minor Issue:**
- `api status` is informational but doesn't show live status (server is not running). Should probably say "Studio offline — run `amc up`" instead of just describing endpoints

---

### Cluster F: Assessment & Reporting (Personas 31–37) — Avg: **7.6/10**

**Issues:**
- `run --score-only` **hangs** without TTY — same problem as `quickscore --auto`
- `demo gap` works well but takes time; no `--json` mode

**Highlights:**
- `demo gap`: ⭐ The 84-point documentation inflation demo is one of AMC's most compelling features. Works beautifully.
- `playground run --json`: Correct JSON scenario output with manual review flags
- `scan --local . --json`: Detects framework (crewai), confidence 1.0, security posture "strong", governance artifacts — very impressive
- `lite-score --help` and `compare --help`: Clean help text, well-structured commands
- `history`: Shows run ledger with VALID/INVALID markers — useful but no filtering options

---

### Cluster G: Advanced Features (Personas 38–44) — Avg: **8.0/10**

All 7 `--help` commands work correctly. No crashes.

**Observations:**
- `monitor --help`: stdin streaming support is unique capability
- `trace list --help`: `--since <hours>` filter is intuitive
- `alert --help`: SIEM/webhook + Slack/PagerDuty support documented well
- `dataset --help`: Golden set management is a strong enterprise differentiator
- `observe --help`: timeline + anomalies are observability staples
- `mcp --help`: IDE integration via stdio MCP is forward-looking
- `host --help`: Multi-workspace bootstrap is enterprise-ready concept

**Gap:** All of these are `--help` only since the commands require running infrastructure. None can be evaluated functionally without a live Studio instance. This inflates ratings but is expected.

---

### Cluster H: Governance & Audit (Personas 45–50) — Avg: **7.8/10**

**Issues:**
- `verify` **FAILED** with 8 errors: 2 missing blob files, 5 invalid writer signatures, 1 receipt verification failure. This is a serious integrity failure in the ledger. For a tool positioned around "evidence-backed trust," having the ledger fail its own verification is a critical UX and trust problem.

**Highlights:**
- `cert generate --help`: PDF/JSON with optional SVG badge — production-ready design
- `pack init --help`: Full scaffold options including license — clean dev experience
- `fix --help`: Auto-remediation with dry-run, target level, framework targeting — excellent concept
- `comms-check --help`: Regulatory domain filtering (wealth/health/governance/tech) — unique differentiator
- `pack test --help`: Sandbox execution with agent targeting

## 4. Top 10 Issues to Fix (Prioritized)

### 🔴 Critical (Breaks Core Workflows)

**P1 — `verify` ledger failure (8 errors)**  
`node dist/cli.js verify` fails with missing blobs and invalid writer signatures. For a product built on cryptographic evidence integrity, this is brand-damaging. The ledger state is corrupted. Must fix and add a `verify --repair` command.

**P2 — Silent hangs on non-TTY (`assurance run --all`, `run --score-only`, `quickscore --auto`)**  
Three commands hang indefinitely without a TTY or Studio. No error, no timeout, no guidance. Add: (a) Studio connectivity check with early exit message, (b) `--ci` / `--no-interactive` flags that fail fast with JSON error.

**P3 — Missing `--force` on `init` and `--demo` on `setup`**  
Both are natural developer commands that users expect. Currently error with "unknown option." These are quick adds with high discovery value.

### 🟠 High (Significant UX Degradation)

**P4 — `shield sanitize` returns 0 removals on SQL injection**  
`"DROP TABLE users; --"` is not sanitized. Either: (a) document that sanitize only targets LLM prompt injection, or (b) add `--mode` flag (prompt/sql/xss). Currently misleading.

**P5 — Compliance coverage capped at ~50%**  
All frameworks report 45–50% coverage on a configured install. This is real (fresh state), but the output should offer a clear next-step: "Run `amc score evidence-coverage` to see which evidence sources to add."

**P6 — `quickscore --auto` not headless**  
`--auto` flag implies non-interactive but still requires TTY. This blocks CI/CD pipelines from auto-scoring. Add `--no-tty` or `--auto` that defaults all answers to L0 and returns JSON.

### 🟡 Medium (Friction for Common Personas)

**P7 — `api status` doesn't detect Studio offline**  
Returns static endpoint documentation even when Studio is not running. Should detect `:3212` unavailability and say so.

**P8 — `history` lacks filtering**  
Shows all runs including INVALID ones without filtering. Add `--valid-only`, `--since`, `--limit` flags.

**P9 — Missing compliance frameworks**  
No HIPAA, PCI_DSS, or ISO_27001 support. Enterprise buyers in healthcare and fintech will notice immediately.

**P10 — `demo gap` has no `--json` mode**  
The gap demo is one of AMC's best features but isn't pipeable. Add `--json` to enable programmatic use in evaluation scripts.

## 5. Comparison with Previous Audits

| Batch | Date | Avg Score | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| Batch 1 | 2026-01 | ~4.8 | Initial audit; many phantom commands |
| Batch 2 | 2026-01 | ~5.0 | Some commands added |
| Batch 3 | 2026-02 | ~5.2 | Scoring and compliance improved |
| Batch 4 | 2026-02 | ~5.4 | Security cluster added |
| Batch 5 | 2026-03 | ~5.6 | Operational and reporting improved |
| **Batch 6** | **2026-03-17** | **7.6** | **Major jump: scoring, compliance, operational all solid** |

**Delta from Batch 1-5 average (5.2) to Batch 6: +2.4 points**

### What Drove the Jump
- Scoring cluster (Personas 6-12) is now best-in-class — 8.6 average
- Operational cluster (Personas 23-30) is the strongest at 8.8
- Compliance reporting works end-to-end for all 5 frameworks
- Security detection (`shield detect-injection`) is impressive at 0.95 confidence
- `explain`, `demo gap`, `scan --local`, `adapters list` are all standout UX moments

### What's Still Holding Back the Score
- Onboarding (4.6) remains the weakest cluster — first-impression failures on common options
- `verify` ledger corruption (critical for trust product credibility)
- Silent hangs without TTY across 3+ commands
- Assurance testing requires live infra with no graceful fallback

### Projected Batch 7 Score
If P1–P3 are fixed: **~8.2/10**  
If all Top 10 are fixed: **~9.0/10**
